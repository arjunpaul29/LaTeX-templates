# LaTeX-templates
This folder contains basic LaTeX templates. I would recommend to use the templates "amsart1.tex", "amsart2.tex" or "amsart3.tex" for writing articles. These are much better than "article1.tex" and "article2.tex" templates. For more LaTeX templates, you may visit https://www.overleaf.com. 

<b>Disclaimer:</b> The files "latex-symbols.pdf", "tikz-cd-doc.pdf" and "xymatrix.pdf" are not written by me, these are collected from internet. All the .tex files of LaTeX templates are forked from various LaTeX templates available online.
